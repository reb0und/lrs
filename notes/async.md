# Fundamentals of Asynchronous Programming: Async. Await, Futures, and Streams
- Modern computers offer two tecnhiques for working on more than one operation at a time: parallelism and concurrency
- Writing programs that involve parallel or concurrent operations, challenges inherent to asynchronous operations are faced, where operations may not finish sequentially in the order they were started
- Alternative approach for asyncrhonous programming: Rust's Futures, Streams, the `async` and `await` syntax that supports them, and the tools for managing and coordinating between asynchronous operations
- Could avoid blocking main thread by spawning a dedicated thread to download each file, but overhead of threads would become a problem, would be preferable if the call didn't block in the first place, could also be better if could write same direct style used in blocking code, similar to:
   - ```let data = fetch_data_from(url).await;
      println!("{data}");```
- This is what Rust's async (asynchronous) abstraction provides
