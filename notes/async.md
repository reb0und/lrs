# Fundamentals of Asynchronous Programming: Async, Await, Futures, Streams
- In order to do other things while waiting for a task on computer to finish, can use parallelism and concurrency
- Asynchronous programming is where operations may not finish sequentially in the order they were started
- Alternative approach to asynchronous programming: Rust's Futures, Streams, `async` and `await` syntax that supports them, and the tools for managing and coordinating between asynchronous operations
