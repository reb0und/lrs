# I/O Project
- Building command line tool that interacts with file and command line input/ouput to practice some of Rust concepts
- Rust's speed, safety, isngle binary output and cross-platform support make it ideal for creaitng command line tools, remaking `grep` (globally search for a regular expression and print), in simplest use case, `grep` searches for a specified file for a specified string, to do so `grep` takes as its argument a filepath and a string, it them reads the file, finds lines in that file that contain the string argument, and prints those lineds
- Along the way, will make command line tool use terminal features that other CLI tools use, will read the value of an environment variable to allow the user to configure the behavior of our tool, will also print error messages to standard error console stream (`stderr`) instead of standard output (`stdout`), for example, user can redirect successful output to a file while still seeing error messages onscreen
- This `grep` project will combine a number of concepts:
   - Organizing code
   - Using vectors and strings
   - Handling errors
   - Using traits and lifetimes when appropriate
   - Writing tests
- Will also touch on closures, iterators, and trait objects

## Accepting Command Line Arguments
- First step is to make `minigrep` accept its two command line arguments, the file path and the string to search for, want to be able to run program with `cargo run`, two hypens to indicate the following arguments are for program rather than for `cargo`: a string to search for and a path to a file to search in
   - Example: `cargo run -- searchstring example-filename.txt`
   - Right now, program generated by `cargo new` cannot process new arguments its provided, some exisitng libraries on crates.io help with writing a program that accepts command line arguments

### Reading the Argument Values
- To enable `minigrep` to read the values of command line arguments passed to it, need to use the `std::env::args` function provided in Rust's standard library, this function returns an iterator of the command line arguments passed to `minigrep`
   - Iterators produce a series of values
   - Can call `collect` method on an iterator to turn it into a collection such as a vector that contains all the elements the iterator produces
- First, must bring the `std::env` module into scope with a `use` statement to use `args` function, nested in two levels of modules, in places where function is nested in more than one module, bring parent module into scope rather than the function, doing so can easily use other functions from `std::env`, also less ambiguous than adding `use std::env::args` and then claling a function with just `args`, since `args` can be mistaken for a function in current module
- On the first line of `main`, `env::args` is called and `collect` is used to turn the iterator into a vector containing all the values produced by the iterator, `collect` is used to create many kinds of collections, specify in annotation of `args` that this should be a vector of strings, rarely need to annotate types in Rust, need to do so on `collect` because it cannot infer the type of collection, vector is printed using debug macro
- 

#### The `args` Function and Invalid Unicode
- Note that `std::env::args` will panic if any argument contains invalid Unicode
- If program needs to accept arguments containing invalid Unicode, can use `std::env::args_os` instead, this function returns an iterator that produces `OsString` values instead of `String` values
- `OsString` values differ per platform and are more complex to work with than `String` values
